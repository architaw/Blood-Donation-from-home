# Blood-Donation-from-home
The idea is to make an app which would enable customers to request blood collection from home. The blood collection would primarily be for pathological testing as requested by the user. The users would also have an option to donate blood. The app would keep the user's result history as well as blood donation history and provide reminder at appropriate intervals for blood test and donations. We also plan to add features to request blood in case of Emergency. The users would have option to compare different pathologies based on their reviews as well as pricing.
